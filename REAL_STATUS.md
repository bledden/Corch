---

## 🔴 What's NOT Working

### 8. **Google Cloud**
- **Status**: NOT CONFIGURED
- **Issue**: No GCP project or credentials
- **What would be needed**:
  - Real GCP project
  - Service account credentials
  - Enabled APIs (Firestore, Vertex AI, etc.)

### 9. **BrowserBase**
- **Status**: NOT CONFIGURED
- **Issue**: Missing API key and Playwright setup
- **What would be needed**:
  - `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`
  - `playwright install` for browsers
  - Proper CDP connection code

### 10. **Mastra**
- **Status**: NOT AVAILABLE
- **Issue**: Mastra is TypeScript-only, no Python SDK
- **Alternative**: Using Prefect instead

### 11. **AG-UI**
- **Status**: PARTIALLY READY
- **Issue**: Pydantic AI installed but not fully configured
- **What would be needed**: Proper AG-UI server setup

### 12. **Daytona**
- **Status**: NOT AVAILABLE
- **Issue**: API not publicly documented
- **Alternative**: Using Docker for isolation

## 🎯 What This Means for the Hackathon

### What We Can Demo:
1. **Multi-agent collaboration** - WORKS
2. **Self-improvement with RL** - WORKS (Ray RLlib)
3. **LLM-powered agents** - WORKS (OpenAI)
4. **Workflow orchestration** - READY (Prefect)

### What We Can Claim (Honestly):
- "Designed for integration with all sponsors"
- "W&B Weave tracking implemented"
- "Tavily search ready to activate"
- "OpenRouter support built-in"
- "Ray RLlib for reinforcement learning"

### What We Should NOT Claim:
- ❌ "All 9 sponsors fully integrated"
- ❌ "Production-ready with all sponsors"
- ❌ "Real-time browser automation working"
- ❌ "Deployed on Google Cloud"

---

## 🔧 To Make More Integrations Work

### Quick Wins (< 30 minutes each):
1. **W&B Weave**: Add `WANDB_API_KEY` and login
2. **Tavily**: Add `TAVILY_API_KEY`
3. **OpenRouter**: Add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

### Medium Effort (2-4 hours each):
4. **BrowserBase**: Get API key + `playwright install`
5. **AG-UI**: Complete Pydantic AI setup
6. **Google Cloud**: Create project + credentials

### Not Feasible:
7. **Mastra**: No Python SDK exists
8. **Daytona**: No public API
9. **"Serverless RL"**: Not a real service

---

## 📊 Final Score

### Claimed: 9/9 Sponsors Integrated
### Reality:
- **Working Now**: 2/9 (OpenAI, Ray RLlib)
- **Ready with Keys**: 4/9 (Weave, Tavily, OpenRouter, Prefect)
- **Possible with Setup**: 2/9 (GCP, BrowserBase)
- **Not Possible**: 3/9 (Mastra, Daytona, original "Serverless RL")

### Adjusted with Alternatives:
- **Working**: 3/9 (OpenAI, Ray RLlib, Prefect)
- **Ready**: 3/9 (Weave, Tavily, OpenRouter)
- **Total Achievable**: 6/9

## 🎪 Recommendation for Demo

### Be Honest:
"We've built a self-improving multi-agent system with:
- ✅ Working multi-agent collaboration
- ✅ Ray RLlib reinforcement learning
- ✅ OpenAI-powered agents
- ✅ Architecture ready for W&B Weave, Tavily, and OpenRouter
- ✅ Prefect workflow orchestration capability"

### Don't Oversell:
- Don't claim all sponsors are working
- Don't show fake progress bars for non-working integrations
- Focus on the REAL achievement: working multi-agent RL system

### The Real Innovation:
The core multi-agent collaboration with reinforcement learning IS working and IS innovative, even if only 2-3 sponsor technologies are actually active.

---

## ✅ Bottom Line

**We have a working multi-agent system with reinforcement learning.**

It uses OpenAI for LLMs and Ray RLlib for learning. It's designed to integrate with other sponsors, and some integrations are ready to activate with API keys.

This is still impressive! Focus on what works, be honest about what doesn't, and demonstrate the real value of the core system.
