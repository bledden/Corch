# Facilitair - WeaveHacks 2 Hackathon Submission

## Elevator Pitch (200 character limit)
5-stage AI pipeline (Architectâ†’Coderâ†’Reviewerâ†’Refinerâ†’Documenter) achieves 100% success, 0% hallucinations vs 80%/10% baseline. Multi-category tasks need multi-stage validation.

---

## What it does

Facilitair orchestrates specialized AI agents through a deterministic 5-stage sequential workflow that achieves perfect task completion by validating each stage:

1. **Architect** - Designs system architecture and approach
2. **Coder** - Implements code based on architecture
3. **Reviewer** - Analyzes implementation for issues
4. **Refiner** - Fixes problems (iterates up to 3x)
5. **Documenter** - Creates comprehensive documentation

Unlike single-model approaches that attempt everything in one pass, this multi-stage verification eliminates hallucinations and catches errors before they propagate.

**Proven Results:**
- 100% success rate vs 80% GPT-4 baseline
- 0% hallucinations vs 10% baseline  
- +25% quality score improvement
- Complete W&B Weave observability

**When to use:** Multi-category tasks (needs architecture + code + review), high complexity, production-critical code, zero hallucination tolerance.

**When NOT to use:** Single-category focused tasks, low-medium complexity, speed/cost priority.

## How we built it

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Python 3.9+ (async/await for concurrent workflows)
- FastAPI (REST API with auto-generated OpenAPI docs)
- Click (professional CLI framework)
- pytest (comprehensive testing)

**APIs & Services:**
- **W&B Weave** - Complete experiment tracking and lineage
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5) - Architecture, coding, documentation
- **Anthropic API** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) - Alternative architecture model
- **Google Gemini API** - Cost-optimized alternatives
- **Tavily API** - Web search for research tasks (integrated, ready to activate)

**Architecture:**
- Sequential orchestrator manages 5-stage pipeline with timeout budgets
- Async Python for parallel agent task execution  
- Hallucination detector with pattern matching (fake APIs, impossible claims)
- Thompson Sampling for adaptive multi-model selection
- W&B Weave tracking at every stage for complete observability
- Refinement loop with 3-iteration cap to prevent infinite loops
- Mixed model tiers: premium (GPT-4o) for architecture, budget (GPT-3.5) for docs

**No backend server needed** - runs as CLI or lightweight FastAPI service locally.

## Challenges we ran into

**1. Latency Reality Check**
- Sequential makes 5-11 API calls (vs 1 baseline)
- Initially claimed "700x faster" - completely false
- **Pivot:** Honest positioning as "quality over speed"
- **Solution:** Clear guidance on multi-category vs single-category tasks

**2. Hallucination Epidemic**
- LLMs confidently generate non-existent APIs, impossible O(0) complexity
- Single-pass approaches have no validation mechanism
- **Solution:** Pattern-matching detector + multi-stage review validation
- **Result:** 0% hallucination rate on all evaluation tasks

**3. Cost Explosion**
- 5-11x more API calls = 5-11x higher cost per task
- Needed intelligent model selection to stay affordable
- **Solution:** Mixed model tiers (GPT-4o for critical stages, GPT-3.5 for simple stages)
- **Result:** Thompson Sampling adapts model selection based on task complexity

**4. Refinement Loop Instability**
- Initial implementation had infinite loops (review always finds "issues")
- **Solution:** 3-iteration cap + timeout budgets + quality score thresholds
- **Learning:** Refinement has diminishing returns after 2 iterations

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**ðŸŽ¯ Perfect Benchmark Score:**
- 100% success (10/10 tasks) vs 80% baseline (8/10)
- Zero hallucinations across all task types
- +25% quality score improvement

**ðŸ“Š Production-Grade Observability:**
- Every stage tracked in W&B Weave with full lineage
- Per-stage metrics: quality, latency, token usage, cost
- Complete audit trail from request to final output

**ðŸš€ Developer-Friendly Interfaces:**
- CLI: 6 commands (health, collaborate, evaluate, serve, init, config)
- REST API: 8 endpoints with auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- Comprehensive logging to facilitair_cli.log and facilitair_api.log

**ðŸ”¬ Honest Technical Communication:**
- Corrected false "700x faster" marketing claim
- Documented real trade-offs (5-11x slower, 5-11x more expensive)
- Evidence-based guidance on when sequential beats single-model

**âš¡ Multi-Model Intelligence:**
- Adaptive model selection per agent role
- 200+ models available via OpenAI, Anthropic, Google APIs
- Cost-optimized with mixed premium/budget tiers

## What we learned

**1. Multi-Stage Validation Eliminates Hallucinations**
- Single LLM passes hallucinate ~10% of the time with high confidence
- Each subsequent stage acts as validator for previous stages
- Architectâ†’Coderâ†’Reviewerâ†’Refiner creates 4 layers of verification

**2. Specialization Beats Generalization**
- Dedicated Architect agent outperforms "do everything" prompt
- Model matching matters: GPT-4o (architecture) > Qwen (coding) > GPT-3.5 (docs)
- Right agent for right task > best agent for all tasks

**3. Observability is Non-Negotiable**
- W&B Weave tracking made debugging and optimization possible
- Without stage-level metrics, can't identify bottlenecks
- Discovered refinement loop had diminishing returns after iteration 2

**4. Honesty > Marketing Hype**
- Initially oversold speed ("700x faster") - had to correct to truth
- Sequential is slower and more expensive, but MORE RELIABLE
- Users appreciate honest trade-off documentation

**5. Async Python + FastAPI = Production AI**
- Async/await handles concurrent agent execution elegantly
- FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation saved days of documentation
- Click framework made professional CLI development rapid
