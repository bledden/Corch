# Codebase Improvement Plan

**Generated**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Analysis Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the Facilitair codebase based on architectural and logic analysis. The codebase is functionally sound but has **2 CRITICAL**, **5 HIGH**, **6 MEDIUM**, and **7 LOW** priority issues that should be addressed for production readiness.

**Estimated Total Effort**: 135-170 hours across 4 phases
**Validation**: All issues verified with exact line numbers by independent code review

### Validation Summary

✅ **All Phase 1 items confirmed** with exact locations
✅ **All critical issues verified** - bare excepts, singleton races, self-imports
✅ **Effort estimates adjusted** based on scope validation:
- Phase 1: 6-7h (reduced from 8h)
- Phase 2: 32-37h (increased from 27h)
- Phase 3: 47-52h (increased from 43h)
- Phase 4: 58h+ (unchanged)

**Key Adjustments**:
- 2.1 Error Handling: 8-10h (was 6h) - type unification across modules
- 2.4 Model Selector: 12-16h (was 10h) - API design and migration
- 3.1 Quality Evaluator: 16-20h (was 12h) - LLM-as-judge integration

**Biggest Near-Term Wins**:
1. Remove bare exception handlers (prevents KeyboardInterrupt masking)
2. Make singletons thread-safe (prevents race conditions)
3. Isolate streaming task execution (removes fragile self-import)

---

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
**Goal**: Fix issues that could cause system failures or security problems
**Estimated Effort**: 6-7 hours (adjusted down from original 8h based on validation)

### 1.1 Replace Bare Exception Handlers ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Effort**: 2 hours
**Impact**: Prevents graceful shutdown, masks debugging

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed
- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:94](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L94) - FormatConverter.to_json
- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:150](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L150) - FormatConverter.convert JSON parse
- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:703](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L703) - _parse_review_result
- [integrations/production_sponsors.py:348](integrations/production_sponsors.py#L348) - Destructor cleanup

**Note**: Many broad `except Exception` blocks also exist. Consider tightening these in streaming/orchestrators after fixing bare excepts. Defer to Phase 2+.

#### Implementation Checklist

**FormatConverter.to_json** (sequential_orchestrator.py:94):
```
[ ] Catch (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError, TypeError) specifically
[ ] Log at warning level with context
[ ] Wrap string in JSON on failure (preserve existing behavior)
```

**FormatConverter.convert JSON parse** (sequential_orchestrator.py:150):
```
[ ] Catch json.JSONDecodeError specifically
[ ] Fall back to {"content": content} (preserve existing behavior)
[ ] Add warning log for failed parse attempts
```

**_parse_review_result** (sequential_orchestrator.py:703):
```
[ ] Catch json.JSONDecodeError and ValueError when parsing match.group(0)
[ ] Log parsing failures for debugging
[ ] Return appropriate fallback value
```

**Destructor cleanup** (production_sponsors.py:348):
```
[ ] Replace bare except: with except Exception as e:
[ ] Log at debug/warning level with exception details
[ ] Never catch BaseException (allows KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit)
```

#### Tests
```
[ ] Unit: Create tests/unit/test_format_converter.py
    [ ] Test invalid JSON string → returns wrapped JSON and logs warning
    [ ] Test _parse_review_result handles malformed JSON without raising
[ ] Validation: Run full test suite (pytest -q)
[ ] Manual check: Verify [ERROR] output logic still works in orchestrator stages
[ ] Repo scan gate: rg -n "except\\s*:\\s*$" -S --glob '!venv' shows no matches
[ ] Optional: Add static rule with ruff E722 if using ruff
```

#### Rollback Plan
- Revert the four targeted hunks only (localized changes)
- Each location is independent, can rollback individually

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero bare `except:` in source code (excluding docs/venv)
- [ ] KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit not caught (code review confirms)
- [ ] Same or better behavior in tests
- [ ] All existing tests pass

**Example**:
```python
# BAD
try:
    parsed = json.loads(data)
except:
    return json.dumps({"content": data}, indent=2)

# GOOD
try:
    parsed = json.loads(data)
except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError, TypeError) as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to parse JSON: {e}")
    return json.dumps({"content": data}, indent=2)
```

### 1.2 Add Thread-Safe Singleton Initialization ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Effort**: 2 hours
**Impact**: Prevents race conditions in multi-threaded FastAPI environment

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed
- [backend/streaming/sse_handler.py:334-342](backend/streaming/sse_handler.py#L334-L342) - Global instance without lock (get_stream_manager)
- [api.py:63-66](api.py#L63-L66) - Lazy global initialization
- [api.py:132-139](api.py#L132-L139) - Can race under concurrent requests (get_orchestrator)

#### Implementation Checklist

**backend/streaming/sse_handler.py** (lines 337-342):
```
[ ] Add module-level threading.Lock()
[ ] Implement double-checked locking around StreamManager creation
[ ] Keep function sync (no need for asyncio.Lock)
[ ] Add docstring comment: "process-wide only" (gunicorn workers each initialize once)
```

**api.py** (lines 132-139):
```
[ ] Add module-level threading.Lock()
[ ] Implement double-checked locking around CollaborativeOrchestrator creation
[ ] Keep function sync (FastAPI can run in multi-threaded workers)
[ ] Add docstring noting singleton behavior
```

#### Tests
```
[ ] Unit: Create tests/unit/test_singletons.py
    [ ] Test get_stream_manager: Spin 50 concurrent tasks calling it via async wrapper
    [ ] Test get_orchestrator: Call inside small async endpoint test
    [ ] Assert all returned id() are identical across calls
    [ ] Assert constructor side effect ran exactly once (instrument with counter via monkeypatch)
[ ] Validation: Run pytest -q -k singleton
[ ] Optional: Load test with Locust/hey against /api/v1/health and /api/stream/task
[ ] Verify no race-induced multiple initializations under concurrency
```

#### Rollback Plan
- Remove the lock and revert to previous simple guard
- Change is localized to 2 functions

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No race-induced multiple initializations observed under concurrency
- [ ] No added latency on hot path beyond negligible lock acquisition
- [ ] Concurrency tests pass (all tasks get same singleton instance)
- [ ] Constructor called exactly once per process

**Example**:
```python
import threading

_stream_manager: Optional[StreamManager] = None
_lock = threading.Lock()

def get_stream_manager() -> StreamManager:
    """Get or create the global StreamManager instance (process-wide only)."""
    global _stream_manager
    if _stream_manager is None:
        with _lock:
            if _stream_manager is None:  # Double-check
                _stream_manager = StreamManager()
    return _stream_manager
```

---

### 1.3 Isolate Task Execution from Streaming Router 🔴 HIGH
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: Fragile self-import pattern, hard to test

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed (self-import workaround)
- [backend/routers/streaming.py:104](backend/routers/streaming.py#L104) - In-function self-import
- [backend/routers/streaming.py:219-447](backend/routers/streaming.py#L219-L447) - Functions to move

**Note**: Not a true circular import yet, but fragile pattern that can become circular as module grows. Moving task execution logic out prevents this.

#### Implementation Checklist

**Create new module backend/services/task_executor.py**:
```
[ ] Create backend/services/ directory if not exists
[ ] Create backend/services/__init__.py
[ ] Create backend/services/task_executor.py
[ ] Move these functions from streaming.py:
    [ ] send_progress_updates(...) - Helper for progress events
    [ ] execute_streaming_task(stream_id, task, context) - Main execution logic
    [ ] stream_collaboration(orchestrator, task, stream_id, manager, builder, state) - Collaboration wrapper
[ ] Import dependencies in task_executor.py:
    [ ] get_stream_manager from backend.streaming.sse_handler
    [ ] StreamEventBuilder, StreamManager from backend.streaming.sse_handler
    [ ] Other necessary imports from orchestrators
```

**Update backend/routers/streaming.py**:
```
[ ] Remove line 104 self-import: from backend.routers.streaming import execute_streaming_task
[ ] Add module-top import: from backend.services.task_executor import execute_streaming_task
[ ] Remove functions that were moved (lines 219-447)
[ ] Verify router endpoints still call execute_streaming_task correctly
[ ] Ensure no back-import from services → routers (one-directional dependency)
```

#### Tests
```
[ ] Integration: Verify existing SSE tests pass
    [ ] tests/integration/test_sse_direct.py
    [ ] tests/integration/test_streaming_live.py
[ ] Smoke test: POST /api/stream/task, then GET /api/stream/events/{stream_id}
    [ ] Verify events arrive in correct order
    [ ] Verify stream completes successfully
[ ] App import check: uvicorn api:app should start without import-time issues
[ ] Grep verification: rg -n "from backend\\.routers\\.streaming import" backend (should be empty)
```

#### Rollback Plan
- Keep a simple re-export shim in routers/streaming.py during cutover:
  ```python
  from backend.services.task_executor import execute_streaming_task
  ```
- This maintains old import path for one release if needed
- Can revert by moving functions back to streaming.py

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No self-import pattern (backend.routers.streaming no longer imports itself)
- [ ] SSE endpoints function identically (events stream and complete)
- [ ] Router imports are acyclic (verified with import graph tool or manual check)
- [ ] Background task execution runs via backend/services/task_executor.py
- [ ] All integration tests pass

---

### Phase 1 General Exit Criteria

**Before marking Phase 1 complete, verify ALL of the following**:

```
[ ] Repo-wide scan: rg -n "except\\s*:\\s*$" -S --glob '!venv' returns no source hits
[ ] Concurrency tests for singletons pass and show single initialization per process
[ ] Router imports are acyclic; background task execution runs via backend/services/task_executor.py
[ ] All tests green: pytest -q
[ ] No regressions in existing functionality (manual smoke test of key endpoints)
[ ] Logging is consistent (use module logger over print() in all touched code)
```

**Scope Note**: Limit Phase 1 to the files/lines listed above. Defer broader improvements like:
- Tightening broad `except Exception` blocks → Phase 2
- Stream memory leak fixes → Phase 2.5
- Additional error handling improvements → Phase 2.1

---

## Phase 2: High Priority (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal**: Fix design issues that affect maintainability and reliability
**Estimated Effort**: 32-37 hours (adjusted up based on validation)

### 2.1 Refactor Error Handling to Use Result Types 🔴 HIGH
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Effort**: 8-10 hours (increased from 6h to account for type unification)
**Impact**: Type-safe error handling, better error metadata

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed "[ERROR]" prefix pattern
- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:387-399](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L387-L399)

- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:463](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L463)
- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:472](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L472)
- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:690-693](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L690-L693)
- [agents/llm_client.py:29-37](agents/llm_client.py#L29-L37) - Has LLMResponse dataclass
- [agents/llm_client.py:216-221](agents/llm_client.py#L216-L221)

**Note**: agents/llm_client.py already has an LLMResponse dataclass. Need to unify/bridge types across orchestrator/API/tests.

**Task**:
```
[ ] Review existing LLMResponse dataclass in agents/llm_client.py
[ ] Create unified Result type system (LLMSuccess/LLMError split)
[ ] Create error types (LLMError, ValidationError, TimeoutError)
[ ] Refactor all "[ERROR]" string returns to use Result types
[ ] Update error checking logic (no more .startswith("[ERROR]"))
[ ] Bridge/unify type usage across orchestrator, API, and tests
[ ] Add error retry logic based on error type
[ ] Update documentation
[ ] Add comprehensive tests for error paths
```

**Design**:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Union

@dataclass
class LLMError:
    error_type: str  # "timeout", "api_error", "rate_limit"
    message: str
    retryable: bool
    original_exception: Optional[Exception] = None

@dataclass
class LLMSuccess:
    content: str
    model: str
    tokens_used: int
    latency_ms: float

LLMResult = Union[LLMSuccess, LLMError]
```

[ ] Document each configuration value
[ ] Test with different configurations
```

---

### 2.3 Add API Request Validation 🔴 HIGH
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Effort**: 3 hours
**Impact**: Prevents DoS, invalid inputs

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed minimal validation
- [api.py:73-90](api.py#L73-L90) - Current Pydantic model (task min_length=1, temperature 0.0-1.0)
- [api.py:178-183](api.py#L178-L183) - Collaborate handler
- [api.py:254-270](api.py#L254-L270) - list_tasks has no response_model
- [api.py:273-303](api.py#L273-L303) - evaluate endpoint lacks limits

**Task**:
```
[ ] Extend Pydantic validators for all request fields

```

---

### 2.4 Consolidate Model Selection Logic 🟡 MEDIUM
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Effort**: 12-16 hours (increased from 10h for API design and testing)
**Impact**: Reduces code duplication, clearer architecture

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed (3 separate implementations)
- [agents/model_selector.py](agents/model_selector.py) - Thompson Sampling
- [agents/strategy_selector.py](agents/strategy_selector.py) - User strategy
- [agents/granular_model_selector.py](agents/granular_model_selector.py) - Task matching

**Note**: Suggest a ModelSelector interface + strategies chosen via config. Migrate callers in orchestrators.

**Task**:
```
[ ] Design unified ModelSelector interface (abstract base class)
[ ] Implement Strategy Pattern:
    [ ] ThompsonSamplingStrategy
    [ ] UserPreferenceStrategy
    [ ] GranularMatchingStrategy
[ ] Add configuration to choose active strategy
[ ] Migrate existing code to use unified interface
[ ] Update orchestrators to use new unified interface

**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Effort**: 3 hours
**Impact**: Memory accumulation in production

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed
- [backend/streaming/sse_handler.py:233-235](backend/streaming/sse_handler.py#L233-L235) - 1-hour schedule
- [backend/streaming/sse_handler.py:295-330](backend/streaming/sse_handler.py#L295-L330) - event_generator breaks but doesn't clean

**Note**: Streams linger for up to an hour; no immediate cleanup after completion. Cleanup is scheduled or manual.

**Task**:
```
[ ] Add immediate cleanup when state becomes completed/error
[ ] Keep 1-hour timeout as safety net for abandoned streams
[ ] Add max_streams limit with LRU eviction policy
[ ] Add basic metrics (active streams, memory usage)
[ ] Test memory usage under sustained load
[ ] Verify cleanup happens in all completion paths
```

---

### 2.6 Add Missing API Validation 🔴 HIGH
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Effort**: 1-2 hours (1h may be tight)
**Impact**: Security and stability

**Files**: Endpoints without strict schemas/limits
- [api.py:254-270](api.py#L254-L270) - list_tasks returns raw dict (no response_model)
- [api.py:273-303](api.py#L273-L303) - evaluate endpoint lacks response_model and input limits

**Task**:
```
[ ] Review all API endpoints for validation gaps
[ ] Add input sanitization to all endpoints
[ ] Add response_model to list_tasks endpoint
[ ] Add response_model and limits to evaluate endpoint
[ ] Add output validation for all endpoints
[ ] Test with fuzzing tools (basic fuzz harness)
```

---

## Phase 3: Robustness Improvements (Weeks 4-5)
**Goal**: Improve observability, testing, and reliability
**Estimated Effort**: 47-52 hours (adjusted up based on validation)

### 3.1 Improve Quality Evaluator Logic 🟡 MEDIUM
**Priority**: P2 - MEDIUM
**Effort**: 16-20 hours (increased from 12h for LLM-as-judge + static analysis)
**Impact**: More accurate quality assessment

**Files**: ✅ Partially present; expansion valid
- [src/evaluation/quality_evaluator.py:69-132](src/evaluation/quality_evaluator.py#L69-L132) - Already parses AST
- [src/evaluation/quality_evaluator.py:173-205](src/evaluation/quality_evaluator.py#L173-L205) - Heuristic checks
- [src/evaluation/quality_evaluator.py:232-286](src/evaluation/quality_evaluator.py#L232-L286) - Current evaluator

**Note**: Already parses AST and runs heuristic checks. Plan adds deeper AST checks, static analysis integration, and LLM-as-judge.

**Task**:
```
[ ] Enhance AST-based structural validation
    [ ] Add deeper syntax error detection
    [ ] Validate import correctness and resolution
    [ ] Verify function/class structure completeness
    [ ] Add complexity metrics (cyclomatic, nesting depth)
[ ] Implement LLM-as-judge for semantic evaluation
    [ ] Design prompts for semantic assessment
    [ ] Integrate with existing LLM client
    [ ] Add caching for repeated evaluations
[ ] Add static analysis integration (pylint, mypy)
[ ] Add unit test generation capability (optional)
[ ] Test against diverse code samples (edge cases)
[ ] Update documentation with new metrics and examples
```

---

### 3.2 Implement Structured Logging 🟡 MEDIUM
**Priority**: P2 - MEDIUM
**Effort**: 8 hours (core paths; more if including demos/scripts)
**Impact**: Better debugging and observability

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed need - many print() calls across runtime code
- [src/orchestrators/collaborative_orchestrator.py:24,36-37,82-83,97,105,146,155](src/orchestrators/collaborative_orchestrator.py#L24) - Multiple prints
- [backend/routers/streaming.py](backend/routers/streaming.py) - Uses logging properly
- [api.py](api.py) - Uses logging
- [integrations/production_sponsors.py:320-336,340-349](integrations/production_sponsors.py#L320-L336) - Prints on errors/cleanup

**Task**:
```
[ ] Install structlog library
[ ] Create logging configuration module
[ ] Add correlation IDs to all log entries (trace context)
[ ] Replace all print() statements with proper logging in:
    [ ] src/orchestrators/
    [ ] integrations/
    [ ] Other runtime modules
[ ] Add timing information to structured logs
[ ] Configure log levels appropriately (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)

**Impact**: Memory efficiency, clarity

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed opportunity
- [src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py:259-319](src/orchestrators/sequential_orchestrator.py#L259-L319) - Context accumulates stage outputs

**Note**: Sequential context accumulates stage outputs in one dict. A StageContext plus consistent truncation/monitoring would improve clarity and memory use.

**Task**:
```
[ ] Create StageContext dataclass for stage-specific data
[ ] Separate stage results from input context (clear boundaries)
[ ] Implement consistent truncation policy (max context size)
[ ] Add context size monitoring (log warnings when large)
[ ] Test memory usage improvements under load
[ ] Update documentation with context management guidelines
```

---

### 3.4 Add Integration Tests for Error Paths 🟡 MEDIUM
**Priority**: P2 - MEDIUM
**Effort**: 16 hours
**Impact**: Confidence in error handling

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed gap
- Current tests in [tests/](tests/) directory are mostly happy-path and surface-level mocks
- Limited adversarial/error coverage; no chaos/fuzz harness

**Task**:
```
[ ] Test all model failures (API errors, rate limits, invalid responses)
[ ] Test timeout scenarios (LLM timeouts, network timeouts)
[ ] Test external service failures (mocked W&B, sponsor APIs)
[ ] Test malformed inputs (invalid JSON, oversized requests)
[ ] Test rate limiting behavior
[ ] Test concurrent request handling (race conditions)
[ ] Add chaos testing framework (optional: chaos-monkey style)
[ ] Document test scenarios and expected behaviors
[ ] Add CI job for error path tests
```

---

- [scripts/benchmarks/run_100_task_benchmark.py:271](scripts/benchmarks/run_100_task_benchmark.py#L271)
- [scripts/benchmarks/run_500_task_benchmark.py:587](scripts/benchmarks/run_500_task_benchmark.py#L587)
- Not CI integrated

**Task**:
```
[ ] Review existing benchmark scripts (10/100/500 tasks)
[ ] Create unified benchmark suite with representative workloads
[ ] Measure p50/p95/p99 latency distributions
[ ] Add CI integration (run benchmarks on PR)

## Phase 4: Long-term Improvements (Ongoing)
**Goal**: Architectural improvements and technical debt reduction
**Estimated Effort**: 58+ hours

### 4.1 Remove Dead Consensus Code 🟢 LOW
**Priority**: P3 - LOW
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: Code clarity, reduced maintenance

**Files**: ✅ Confirmed likely dead
- [src/orchestrators/collaborative_orchestrator.py:260](src/orchestrators/collaborative_orchestrator.py#L260) - Wrapper sets consensus_method="sequential_workflow"
- [src/orchestrators/collaborative_orchestrator.py:342-527](src/orchestrators/collaborative_orchestrator.py#L342-L527) - Consensus code sits unused (400+ lines)

**Note**: Sequential mode is the active path; consensus methods appear unused in current sequential flow.

**Task**:
```
[ ] Confirm consensus logic is never called (grep for consensus_method usage)
[ ] Remove consensus methods from collaborative_orchestrator.py (400+ lines)
[ ] Update documentation to clarify sequential-only architecture
[ ] Run full test suite to ensure no breakage
[ ] Update architecture diagrams (remove consensus flow)
[ ] Archive removed code for reference (git history)
```

---

### 4.2 Improve Type Safety 🟢 LOW
**Priority**: P3 - LOW
**Effort**: 15 hours (plausible, may stretch depending on strictness)
**Impact**: IDE support, fewer bugs

**Files**: Mixed typing throughout
- Many `Dict[str, Any]` and untyped functions across codebase
- No mypy configuration found

**Task**:
```
[ ] Audit current type annotation coverage
[ ] Convert Dict[str, Any] to TypedDict or dataclasses
[ ] Add type hints to all function signatures (focus on public APIs)
[ ] Configure mypy in strict mode (or start with --check-untyped-defs)
[ ] Add mypy to CI/CD pipeline
[ ] Fix all type errors incrementally
[ ] Update documentation with type safety guidelines
[ ] Consider using pyright as alternative/supplement
```

---

### 4.3 Clean Up Async/Await Patterns 🟢 LOW
**Priority**: P3 - LOW
**Effort**: 5 hours
**Impact**: Code clarity, performance

**Files**: ✅ Valid concern
- No glaring abuses found in hot paths during review
- A comprehensive sweep is still beneficial

**Task**:
```
[ ] Audit all async functions for actual async work (I/O, await calls)
[ ] Convert sync work to sync functions (remove unnecessary async)
[ ] Document async boundaries and why functions are async
[ ] Add asyncio best practices guide to documentation
[ ] Remove unnecessary async/await overhead
[ ] Ensure proper async context management
```

---

### 4.4 Refactor to Clean Architecture 🟢 LOW
**Priority**: P3 - LOW
**Effort**: 30 hours (floor; substantial work)
**Impact**: Long-term maintainability

**Files**: ✅ Valid long-term goal
- Current architecture mixes concerns (domain, infrastructure)
- Large undertaking requiring incremental approach

**Task**:
```
[ ] Design domain model (Task, Stage, Workflow entities)
[ ] Separate domain logic from infrastructure (APIs, LLM clients)
[ ] Implement dependency injection (avoid hard-coded dependencies)
[ ] Create clear layer boundaries (domain, application, infrastructure)
[ ] Update tests to use new architecture (test domain independently)
[ ] Document architecture decisions (ADRs)
[ ] Keep this staged and incremental (not all-at-once)
[ ] Consider starting with one module as proof-of-concept
```

---

### 4.5 Add Circuit Breaker for LLM Calls 🟡 MEDIUM
**Priority**: P3 - LOW
**Effort**: 3 hours
**Impact**: Better resilience, prevent cascading failures

**Files**: ✅ Valid addition
- [agents/llm_client.py:80-98](agents/llm_client.py#L80-L98) - No breaker around litellm.acompletion

**Task**:
```
[ ] Install circuit breaker library (e.g., pybreaker, circuitbreaker)
[ ] Add circuit breaker wrapper around litellm.acompletion calls
[ ] Configure failure thresholds (error rate, timeout)
[ ] Add monitoring for circuit state (open, half-open, closed)
[ ] Test failure and recovery scenarios
[ ] Add fallback behavior when circuit is open
[ ] Log circuit state changes for observability

- Gradual rollout with feature flags

### Risk 2: Time Estimates Too Low
**Mitigation**:
- Add 30% buffer to all estimates
- Prioritize critical issues first
- Can pause after each phase

### Risk 3: Regression Bugs
**Mitigation**:
- Add tests before refactoring
- Use code coverage tools
- Pair programming for critical changes
