## [IDEA] Unique Value Propositions

### 1. Self-Improving Through Learning
```python
@weave.op()
async def _learn_from_collaboration(result, task_type):
    """
    Updates agent performance scores based on results
    Learns optimal:
    - Agent combinations
    - Consensus methods
    - Team sizes
    - Collaboration patterns
    """
```

### 2. Thompson Sampling for Model Selection
- Balances exploration (trying new models) vs exploitation (using best known)
- Adapts to changing performance characteristics
- Cost-aware decision making

### 3. Multiple Consensus Methods
- **Voting**: Democratic majority
- **Weighted Voting**: Expert opinions weighted higher
- **Debate**: Agents argue until agreement
- **Synthesis**: Combine all perspectives
- **Hierarchy**: Expert has final say

### 4. Strategy-Based Model Selection
User can choose strategy:
- **QUALITY_FIRST**: Best models, regardless of cost
- **COST_FIRST**: Free open-source models only
- **BALANCED**: Smart mix for best value
- **SPEED_FIRST**: Fastest response times
- **PRIVACY_FIRST**: Local models only
