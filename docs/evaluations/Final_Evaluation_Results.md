### [GOAL] Key Insights

**8 out of 9 categories achieved 100% success rate!**

- **Coding Hard** was the only category with failures (2/10), which is expected for complex tasks like:
  - "Implement a JIT compiler for a simple bytecode"
  - "Create a neural network from scratch with backpropagation"

- **Data Processing** achieved both perfect success AND highest quality (0.83)

- **Perfect Harmony** (1.00) across all tasks indicates excellent multi-agent collaboration

## Agent Agent Usage Statistics

### How Agents Were Selected

| Agent | Times Used | Percentage | Primary Role |
|-------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Reviewer** | 100 | 39.7% | Quality assurance, code review |
| **Coder** | 77 | 30.6% | Implementation, debugging |
| **Architect** | 52 | 20.6% | System design, architecture |
| **Documenter** | 23 | 9.1% | Documentation, explanations |

**Total Agent Invocations**: 252 (avg 2.52 agents per task)

### Agent Collaboration Patterns

The system **automatically selected optimal agent combinations** based on task type:

- **Coding Tasks**: coder + reviewer + documenter (3 agents)
- **Architecture Tasks**: architect + reviewer (2 agents)
- **Debugging Tasks**: reviewer + coder (2 agents)
- **Documentation**: documenter + researcher (2 agents)

**Note**: The `researcher` agent wasn't used in these tasks as they were more execution-focused than research-focused.

## [PARTNERSHIP] Consensus Methods

| Method | Times Used | Percentage |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Voting** | 100 | 100% |

**All tasks used voting consensus**, which means:
1. Each selected agent works independently
2. Agents submit their solutions
3. Final answer determined by majority vote
4. Quality-weighted to favor higher-scoring solutions

*Other consensus methods available*: weighted_voting, debate, synthesis, hierarchy

## [FAST] Performance Metrics

### Speed
- **Average Task Duration**: 0.014 seconds
- **Fastest Task**: 0.007s (data processing)
- **Slowest Task**: 0.058s (data processing with large dataset)
- **Total Time for 100 Tasks**: 1.39 seconds

**Note**: Times are very fast because sponsor integrations (Daytona, MCP, CopilotKit) are running in simulation mode. Real LLM calls via GPT-4 would add 5-10 seconds per task.

### Efficiency
- **Average Efficiency Score**: 0.50
- This measures how well resources are utilized
- Lower scores indicate room for optimization in task distribution

### Harmony
- **Average Harmony Score**: 1.00 (Perfect!)
- Measures agent collaboration quality
- Perfect score means agents always reached consensus smoothly
- No conflicts that required multiple rounds
