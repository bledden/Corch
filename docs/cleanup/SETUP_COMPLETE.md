# WeaveHacks Collaborative System - Setup Complete! üéâ

## What We've Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Environment Setup
- Created and configured `.env` file with API keys
- OpenAI API key connected and working
- Other LLM APIs set to demo mode for testing

### ‚úÖ Service Connections
- **OpenAI API**: ‚úÖ Connected and tested
- **W&B Weave**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Demo mode (no API key required for testing)
- **Other LLMs**: Configured for simulation mode

### ‚úÖ Dependencies Installed
All required Python packages installed:
- `weave` - W&B tracking
- `openai` - GPT models
- `anthropic` - Claude models
- `google-generativeai` - Gemini models
- `rich` - Terminal UI
- `pyyaml` - Configuration
- `aiohttp` - Async HTTP
- `numpy` - Numerical operations

### ‚úÖ Code Fixes Applied
1. Fixed OpenAI client to use new API (v1.0+)
2. Replaced deprecated `weave.log` calls with console output
3. Added missing `time` import
4. Updated environment check logic

### ‚úÖ Repository Status
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/[your-username]/weavehacks-collaborative
- All code pushed and ready
- `.env.example` updated with clear instructions

## How to Run

### 1. Setup Services (Already Complete)
```bash
python3 setup_services.py
```

### 2. Run Demos

#### Interactive Strategy Demo (requires terminal input):
```bash
python3 demo_with_strategy.py
```

#### Full Training Demo:
```bash
python3 demo.py --fast  # Quick 5 generation demo
python3 demo.py         # Full 10 generation training
```

#### Non-Interactive Test:
```bash
python3 run_demo_non_interactive.py
```

## System Architecture

### 5 Specialized Agents
1. **Architect** - System design and planning
2. **Coder** - Implementation and coding
3. **Reviewer** - Code review and quality
4. **Documenter** - Documentation and tutorials
5. **Researcher** - Research and analysis

### Consensus Methods
- **Voting** - Simple majority
- **Weighted Voting** - Expertise-based
- **Debate** - Argue until consensus
- **Synthesis** - Combine all perspectives
- **Hierarchy** - Domain expert decides

### Model Selection Strategies
- **QUALITY_FIRST** - Best models regardless of cost
- **COST_FIRST** - Free open-source models only
- **BALANCED** - Smart mix for best value
- **SPEED_FIRST** - Fastest response times
- **PRIVACY_FIRST** - Local models only

## Key Features

### üöÄ Performance
- 52K requests/second capability (from Facilitair)
- Parallel agent execution
- Smart caching and routing

### üß† Intelligence
- Multi-model orchestration
- Thompson Sampling for optimal model selection
- Self-improving through experience

### üìä Tracking
- W&B Weave integration for metrics
- Learning curves visualization
- Performance tracking per model

## Next Steps for Hackathon

1. **Add Real W&B API Key** (if available)
   - Get from: https://wandb.ai/settings
   - Add to `.env` file

2. **Add More LLM API Keys** (optional)
   - Anthropic for Claude models
   - Google for Gemini models
   - OpenRouter for open-source models

3. **Customize for Challenge**
   - Modify agent personalities in `config.yaml`
   - Add domain-specific expertise
   - Tune consensus methods

4. **Run Training**
   - Use `demo.py` to train the system
   - Watch agents learn to collaborate
   - Track improvements in W&B

## Demo Talking Points

### Opening Hook
"What if AI agents could learn to work better together over time, just like human teams?"

### Problem Statement
- Current multi-agent systems are static
- They make the same coordination mistakes
- No learning from past collaborations

### Our Solution
- Self-improving collaborative system
- Learns WHO to work with
- Learns HOW to reach consensus
- Learns WHEN to defer to experts

### Live Demo
1. Show untrained chaos (Generation 1)
2. Show learning progress (Generation 5)
3. Show trained harmony (Generation 10)

### Technical Differentiators
- Thompson Sampling for exploration/exploitation
- Multiple consensus strategies
- Real-time learning with W&B Weave
- Open-source model support

## Status: READY FOR WEAVEHACKS 2! üöÄ

The system is configured, tested, and ready to showcase at the hackathon.
All services are connected (OpenAI working, others in demo mode).
The collaborative orchestrator is initialized and ready to learn.

Good luck at WeaveHacks 2! üéâ
