5. **IBM Granite 3.x** - Outperforms models 2x its size

## [CHART] Head-to-Head Comparisons

### SWE-bench (Real-World Coding)
```
Claude Sonnet 4.5:     77.2% (Closed - $3/$15 per M tokens)
GPT-5:                 74.9% (Closed - $$$)
DeepSeek V3:           42%   (Open - Free!)
Qwen 2.5:              ~38%  (Open - Free!)
```

### Cost Analysis
```
GPT-5:                 $15-30 per million tokens
Claude 4.5:            $3-15 per million tokens
Qwen 2.5 Coder:        $0 (open-source)
DeepSeek V3:           $0 (open-source)
```

### Performance per Dollar
```
Qwen 2.5:              ∞ (free, matches GPT-4o)
DeepSeek V3:           ∞ (free, 85% of GPT-5)
Claude Sonnet 4.5:     High performance, moderate cost
GPT-5:                 Highest performance, highest cost
```

##  Surprising Findings

### Open-Source Victories
1. **Qwen 2.5 Coder = GPT-4o performance** (confirmed by benchmarks)
2. **DeepSeek V3 offers 85% performance** of closed models
3. **Granite 8B beats models 16B+** in size
4. **Mistral Small 3 competes with 70B** models

### Closed-Source Surprises
1. **Claude Sonnet 4.5 > Opus 4.1** (despite naming hierarchy)
2. **Sonnet 4.5 is 5x cheaper** than Opus 4.1
3. **GPT-5 not always best** - Claude 4.5 better for bug catching
4. **Context windows matter** - Gemini 2.5's 2M tokens game-changing

## [COST] The Economics

### When to Use Closed-Source
- **Critical production code** where 5-10% matters
- **Complex reasoning** requiring O4/Claude 4.5
- **Regulatory compliance** needing commercial support
- **One-off tasks** where infrastructure isn't worth it

### When to Use Open-Source
- **Most coding tasks** (Qwen 2.5 = GPT-4o quality)
- **High-volume processing** (save 100% on API costs)
- **Privacy-sensitive** applications
- **Custom fine-tuning** needed
- **Edge deployment** required

##  Optimal Strategy for WeaveHacks

### Recommended Hybrid Approach
```yaml
# Use open-source as default
default_models:
  coder: qwen2.5-coder-32b      # Free, matches GPT-4o
  reviewer: deepseek-v3          # Free, 85% performance
  documenter: llama-3.3-70b      # Free, strong quality

# Escalate to closed-source when needed
premium_fallbacks:
  complex_reasoning: gpt-5/o4
  bug_detection: claude-4.5-sonnet
  large_context: gemini-2.5-pro
```

### Cost Savings
- **70-90%** reduction using open-source defaults
- **100%** savings on routine tasks
- Pay only for complex/critical tasks

##  Key Takeaways

1. **Open-source has arrived** - Qwen 2.5 matching GPT-4o is a watershed moment
2. **Hybrid is optimal** - Use open for most, closed for critical
3. **Cost no longer correlates with quality** - Sonnet 4.5 > Opus 4.1 at 1/5 cost
4. **Specialization matters** - Codestral for languages, Granite for enterprise
5. **The gap is closing fast** - 42% → 77% SWE-bench is massive progress

## [UP] Trend Analysis

### What Changed in 2025
- Open models went from "good enough" to "genuinely competitive"
- Cost-performance ratio completely inverted
- Specialization (coding, math, etc.) became key differentiator
- Context windows exploded (2M+ tokens)

### What's Coming Next
- Open models likely to match closed within 6-12 months
- Specialization will increase (domain-specific models)
- Edge deployment will become standard
- Hybrid architectures (MoE) will dominate

## [ACHIEVEMENT] Final Recommendations

### For WeaveHacks 2
1. **Lead with open-source** - Shows innovation and cost awareness
2. **Use Qwen 2.5 Coder** as primary (matches GPT-4o!)
3. **Add DeepSeek V3** for cost efficiency story
4. **Keep GPT-5/Claude 4.5** for complex edge cases
5. **Emphasize the 100% cost savings** while maintaining quality

### The Pitch
"We achieve GPT-4o quality at zero API cost using Qwen 2.5 Coder, with intelligent escalation to GPT-5/Claude 4.5 only when truly needed. This hybrid approach delivers enterprise quality at startup costs."
