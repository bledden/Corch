# CodeSwarm - Final Model Selection (October 18, 2025)

**Based on latest OpenRouter models + agent specialization**

---

## 🎯 OPTIMAL MODEL SELECTION PER AGENT

### Architecture Agent: **OpenAI GPT-5 Pro**
```python
model = "openai/gpt-5-pro"
```

**Why**:
- GPT-5 Pro = Latest reasoning flagship
- System design requires deep architectural thinking
- Best for high-level API structure, data flow, component organization
- Worth the cost for critical architecture decisions

**Fallback**: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` (if GPT-5 Pro unavailable)

---

### Implementation Agent: **OpenAI GPT-5** (base)
```python
model = "openai/gpt-5"
```

**Why**:
- Base GPT-5 for code generation (not Pro - overkill for implementation)
- Proven code generation capabilities
- Balances quality with cost
- Your tests already confirmed GPT-5 works in your system

**Fallback**: `nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5` (open source alternative)

---

### Security Agent: **Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5**
```python
model = "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
```

**Why**:
- Claude 4.5 series = Latest Anthropic (newer than your 4.1!)
- Haiku = Fast + security-focused reasoning
- OWASP compliance, vulnerability detection
- Anthropic sponsor = showcase their latest model!

**Fallback**: `qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-thinking` (thinking mode for security analysis)

---

### Testing Agent: **NVIDIA Llama 3.3 Nemotron Super 49B**
```python
model = "nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5"
```

**Why**:
- Open source = cost-effective for high-volume test generation
- "Super" variant = enhanced performance
- 49B parameters = quality without flagship cost
- Fast test generation (not reasoning-heavy like architecture)

**Fallback**: `qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-instruct` (faster, lighter)

---

## 🧠 DEEP RESEARCH MODELS (Special Bonus)

### For Complex Tasks (Optional Enhancement):
```python
# If task complexity > 8/10, use deep research models
DEEP_RESEARCH_MODELS = {
    "architecture_complex": "openai/o3-deep-research",     # O3 for super complex architecture
    "multi_step_reasoning": "openai/o4-mini-deep-research" # O4-mini for planning
}
```

**Use Case**: If user asks for "Build microservices architecture with event sourcing"
- Trigger O3 Deep Research for architecture phase
- Regular GPT-5 Pro for implementation

---

## 🎨 VISION MODELS (Future Enhancement)

For tasks involving diagrams, screenshots, or visual documentation:
```python
VISION_MODELS = {
    "diagram_analysis": "openai/gpt-5-image",          # GPT-5 with vision
    "screenshot_to_code": "qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct",  # Qwen3 vision
    "ui_mockup": "google/gemini-2.5-flash-image"       # Gemini 2.5 Flash
}
```

**Demo Enhancement**: "Convert this Figma screenshot to React code"
- Use `qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct` to analyze mockup
- Implementation Agent generates code

---

## 🧪 THINKING MODELS (Quality Boost)

For complex reasoning that benefits from chain-of-thought:
```python
THINKING_MODELS = {
    "security_analysis": "qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-thinking",  # Security with reasoning trace
    "architecture_planning": "qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-thinking",   # Cheaper thinking for planning
    "error_debugging": "baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b-thinking"   # Debugging with reasoning
}
```

**When to Use**: If Galileo score < 85 on first attempt
- Switch to "thinking" variant for that agent
- Get reasoning trace to understand why quality was low
- Use trace to improve next iteration

---

## 💰 COST-PERFORMANCE TIERS

### Tier 1: Premium (Best Quality)
```python
PREMIUM_TIER = {
    "architecture": "openai/gpt-5-pro",
    "implementation": "openai/gpt-5",
    "security": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
    "testing": "nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5"
}
```
**Use For**: Production code, critical features, demo
**Estimated Cost**: ~$0.15-0.25 per complete task

### Tier 2: Balanced (Quality + Cost)
```python
BALANCED_TIER = {
    "architecture": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
    "implementation": "nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5",
    "security": "qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct",
    "testing": "qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-instruct"
}
```
**Use For**: Rapid prototyping, iteration
**Estimated Cost**: ~$0.05-0.10 per task

### Tier 3: Experimental (Cutting Edge)
```python
EXPERIMENTAL_TIER = {
    "deep_reasoning": "openai/o3-deep-research",
    "vision_tasks": "qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-thinking",
    "novel_models": "deepcogito/cogito-v2-preview-llama-405b",
    "emerging": "z-ai/glm-4.6"
}
```
**Use For**: Hackathon wow factor, bleeding edge demo
**Risk**: May be unstable, limited testing
