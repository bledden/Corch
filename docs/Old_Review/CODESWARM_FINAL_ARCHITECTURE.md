# CodeSwarm - Final Architecture (The Complete Vision)

**Time**: 4h 40min
**Goal**: Combine ALL three concepts into one killer demo

---

## 🎯 THE UNIFIED VISION: "CodeSwarm IDE"

**One-Line Pitch**: "A self-improving multi-agent coding IDE where specialist agents collaborate in Daytona workspaces, learn from Galileo evaluations, and get better with every PR - powered by Anthropic Claude and Browser Use."

### The Complete Flow:
```
Developer opens Daytona workspace (dev environment)
    ↓
CodeSwarm IDE extension activates
    ↓
User (authenticated via WorkOS): "Build secure FastAPI OAuth endpoint"
    ↓
[MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION - Split Screen Demo]
    ├─ Architecture Agent: Claude browses OAuth 2.0 specs (Browser Use)
    ├─ Implementation Agent: Claude browses FastAPI docs (Browser Use)
    ├─ Security Agent: Claude browses OWASP best practices (Browser Use)
    └─ Testing Agent: Claude browses pytest documentation (Browser Use)
    ↓
Each agent submits their code contribution
    ↓
[GALILEO EVALUATION - Quality Gate]
Galileo scores each contribution:
- Architecture: 92/100 ✅
- Implementation: 88/100 ⚠️ (needs improvement)
- Security: 95/100 ✅
- Testing: 90/100 ✅
    ↓
[AUTONOMOUS LEARNING - Self-Improvement]
CodeSwarm identifies Implementation agent scored low
    ↓
Implementation Agent re-generates with learned patterns
    ↓
Galileo re-scores: 94/100 ✅
    ↓
[FINAL SYNTHESIS]
Combined code quality: 92.75/100
    ↓
Code committed to Daytona workspace
    ↓
[LEARNING STORAGE via WorkOS]
Pattern stored for team: "FastAPI OAuth" → quality 92.75
Next developer on team gets 96/100 on similar task!
```

## 🔧 SPONSOR INTEGRATION (ALL 6!)

### 1. **Anthropic Claude** - The Brain
**How Exactly**:
- **4 specialized agents**, each with distinct Claude system prompts:

```python
# Architecture Agent
system_prompt = """You are an Architecture Specialist AI.
Your role: Design high-level system architecture.
Focus: API structure, data flow, component organization.
Use documentation you browse to ensure best practices."""

# Implementation Agent
system_prompt = """You are an Implementation Specialist AI.
Your role: Write production-ready code.
Focus: Clean code, error handling, type safety.
Use documentation you browse for accurate syntax."""

# Security Agent
system_prompt = """You are a Security Specialist AI.
Your role: Identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
Focus: Authentication, authorization, input validation, OWASP Top 10.
Use documentation you browse for security best practices."""

# Testing Agent
system_prompt = """You are a Testing Specialist AI.
Your role: Write comprehensive test suites.
Focus: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, 90%+ coverage.
Use documentation you browse for testing frameworks."""
```

**Claude API Usage**:
```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))

async def agent_reason(agent_type: str, task: str, browsed_docs: str):
    """Each agent uses Claude for reasoning"""
    response = await client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514",
        max_tokens=2000,
        system=AGENT_PROMPTS[agent_type],
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""Task: {task}

Documentation I just browsed:
{browsed_docs}

Generate your specialized contribution."""
        }]
    )
    return response.content[0].text
```

**Why This Works**:
- Each agent has DIFFERENT expertise via system prompts
- Claude's reasoning + real-time docs = accurate, current code
- 4 parallel Claude calls = 4x the API credit usage (good for sponsor!)

---

### 2. **Browser Use** - The Knowledge Gatherer
**How Exactly**:
- Each agent independently browses documentation in real-time
- Addresses your concern: "Models need doc context via back-and-forth"
- Solution: **Agent browses FIRST, then reasons with full context**

```python
from browser_use import Browser

async def agent_browse_docs(agent_type: str, task: str):
    """Each agent browses relevant documentation"""

    browser = Browser(headless=False)  # Visible for demo!

    # Agent-specific doc sources
    if agent_type == "architecture":
        url = "https://oauth.net/2/"
        query = "OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow best practices"

    elif agent_type == "implementation":
        url = "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/"
        query = "FastAPI OAuth2 JWT implementation"

    elif agent_type == "security":
        url = "https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/"
        query = "OWASP API security authentication"

    elif agent_type == "testing":
        url = "https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/fixtures.html"
        query = "pytest fixtures for API testing"

    # Browse and extract
    page = await browser.goto(url)
    docs = await page.search(query)  # Browser Use semantic search
    relevant_text = await docs.extract_text(max_length=3000)

    return relevant_text
```

**The Split-Screen Magic**:

```

**Why This Crushes**:
1. **Solves your doc context problem**: Agent gets full docs BEFORE reasoning
2. **Visual spectacle**: Watch 4 browsers open simultaneously
3. **Browser Use is THE HERO**: Not just tacked on, it's critical
4. **Always current**: Scrapes latest docs, never outdated

---

### 3. **Galileo** - The Quality Judge
**How Exactly**:
- Evaluates EACH agent contribution individually
- Drives the learning loop (only store 90+ patterns)
- Creates competitive dynamic between agents

```python
from galileo_observe import GalileoObserve

galileo = GalileoObserve(api_key=os.getenv("GALILEO_API_KEY"))

async def evaluate_contribution(agent_type: str, code: str, task: str):
    """Galileo evaluates each agent's code contribution"""

    evaluation = await galileo.evaluate(
        project="codeswarm-hackathon",
        input=task,
        output=code,
        metadata={
            "agent": agent_type,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        },
        metrics=[
            "correctness",      # Does it work?
            "completeness",     # All requirements met?
            "code_quality",     # Clean, readable, maintainable?
            "security",         # No vulnerabilities?
            "test_coverage"     # (for testing agent only)
        ]
    )

    # Galileo returns 0-100 score
    score = evaluation.aggregate_score

    # Store detailed feedback
    feedback = evaluation.feedback  # What needs improvement

    return {
        "score": score,
        "feedback": feedback,
        "metrics": evaluation.metric_scores
    }
```

**The Galileo Dashboard Moment**:

```

**Why This Wins Galileo Prize**:
- Galileo is THE DECISION MAKER (not just measuring)
- Scores drive which code gets used
- Scores drive learning (only store 90+ patterns)
- Real-time quality feedback loop
- Multiple evaluation dimensions (not just pass/fail)

---

### 4. **Daytona** - The Development Environment
**How Exactly**:
- CodeSwarm runs INSIDE Daytona workspace
- All agent-generated code goes directly into Daytona dev environment
- Team collaboration via Daytona shared workspaces

```python
# daytona_integration.py

class DaytonaWorkspace:
    """CodeSwarm runs inside Daytona development environment"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.workspace_id = os.getenv("DAYTONA_WORKSPACE_ID")
        self.api_key = os.getenv("DAYTONA_API_KEY")

    async def create_project(self, project_name: str):
        """Create new project in Daytona workspace"""
        # Use Daytona API to scaffold project
        workspace = await daytona.create_workspace(
            name=f"codeswarm-{project_name}",
            template="python-fastapi"  # Pre-configured environment
        )
        return workspace

    async def commit_code(self, files: Dict[str, str]):
        """Commit agent-generated code to workspace"""
        for filepath, content in files.items():
            await daytona.write_file(
                workspace_id=self.workspace_id,
                path=filepath,
                content=content
            )

        # Auto-commit in Daytona git
        await daytona.git_commit(
            workspace_id=self.workspace_id,
            message="CodeSwarm: Multi-agent collaboration complete"
        )

    async def run_tests(self):
        """Execute tests in Daytona environment"""
        result = await daytona.exec(
            workspace_id=self.workspace_id,
            command="pytest tests/ -v --cov"
        )
        return result
```

**The Daytona Demo Moment**:
```
[Show Daytona dashboard on screen]

"Here's my Daytona workspace - empty project."

[CodeSwarm generates code via agents]

"Watch as all 4 agent contributions get committed to Daytona..."

[Files appear in Daytona workspace in real-time:
- app/auth.py (Implementation Agent)
- app/models.py (Architecture Agent)
- app/security.py (Security Agent)
- tests/test_auth.py (Testing Agent)]

"Now let's run the tests in Daytona..."

[Terminal in Daytona shows: pytest ... 18 passed, 92% coverage ✅]

"Production-ready code, in a production-ready environment,
generated by AI agents in 45 seconds."
```

**Why This Wins Daytona Prize**:
- CodeSwarm is **NATIVE to Daytona** (not external tool)
- Showcases Daytona's value: instant dev environment
- Team can collaborate on same CodeSwarm workspace
- Tests run in Daytona (full dev lifecycle)

---

### 5. **WorkOS** - The Team Layer
**How Exactly**:
- Team authentication (who's using CodeSwarm)
- Shared learning across team members
- Track which agents work best for which developers

```python
from workos import WorkOS

workos = WorkOS(api_key=os.getenv("WORKOS_API_KEY"))

class TeamLearning:
    """WorkOS-powered team knowledge sharing"""

    async def authenticate_developer(self, email: str):
        """Authenticate developer via WorkOS SSO"""
        user = await workos.sso.get_profile(email)
        return {
            "user_id": user.id,
            "team_id": user.organization_id,
            "name": user.first_name
        }

    async def store_team_pattern(self, team_id: str, pattern: Dict):
        """Store successful patterns for entire team"""
        # Use WorkOS Directory API to share across team
        await workos.directory.create_resource(
            organization_id=team_id,
            resource_type="codeswarm_pattern",
            data={
                "task_type": pattern["task"],
                "quality_score": pattern["galileo_score"],
                "agent_contributions": pattern["code"],
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
            }
        )

    async def get_team_patterns(self, team_id: str, task_type: str):
        """Retrieve team's learned patterns"""
        patterns = await workos.directory.list_resources(
            organization_id=team_id,
            resource_type="codeswarm_pattern",
            filters={"task_type": task_type}
        )

        # Return top 3 highest quality patterns
        return sorted(patterns, key=lambda p: p["quality_score"], reverse=True)[:3]
```

**The WorkOS Demo Moment**:
```
[Show WorkOS dashboard]

Developer 1 (you): "Build FastAPI OAuth endpoint"
- Galileo Score: 91/100
- Pattern stored for team

[Switch to Developer 2 account via WorkOS SSO]

Developer 2: "Build FastAPI OAuth with MFA"
- CodeSwarm loads team patterns from Developer 1
- Uses learned OAuth knowledge
- Galileo Score: 96/100 (better because of team learning!)

[Show WorkOS Team Analytics:]
Team "Hackathon Squad" patterns:
- FastAPI Auth: 5 patterns, avg quality 93/100
- React Components: 3 patterns, avg quality 88/100
- Database Queries: 8 patterns, avg quality 91/100
```

**Why This Wins**:
- WorkOS enables **TEAM self-improvement** (not just individual)
- SSO makes multi-developer demo seamless
- Shows enterprise-grade features (organizations, teams, auth)

---

### 6. **Daytona Credits** (Bonus Integration)
**How**: Deploy CodeSwarm itself IN Daytona
**Why**: Meta - "We built our agent platform inside the dev environment it targets"
**Demo**: Show CodeSwarm running in Daytona, generating code in Daytona workspaces

---

## 🧠 THE SELF-IMPROVING LOOP (Combining Concepts)

### How Autonomous Learning Works:

```python
# autonomous_learning.py (from Anomaly Hunter, adapted)

class CodeSwarmLearner:
    """Learn from Galileo evaluations to improve over time"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {}  # Successful code patterns
        self.agent_performance = {
            "architecture": {"total": 0, "avg_score": 0},
            "implementation": {"total": 0, "avg_score": 0},
            "security": {"total": 0, "avg_score": 0},
            "testing": {"total": 0, "avg_score": 0}
        }

    async def learn_from_evaluation(self, task_type: str, contributions: Dict, galileo_scores: Dict):
        """Store patterns from high-quality contributions"""

        for agent, code in contributions.items():
            score = galileo_scores[agent]["score"]

            # Update agent performance tracking
            self.agent_performance[agent]["total"] += 1
            prev_avg = self.agent_performance[agent]["avg_score"]
            new_avg = (prev_avg * (self.agent_performance[agent]["total"] - 1) + score) / self.agent_performance[agent]["total"]
            self.agent_performance[agent]["avg_score"] = new_avg

            # Store high-quality patterns (90+ score)
            if score >= 90:
                pattern_key = f"{task_type}_{agent}"
                if pattern_key not in self.patterns:
                    self.patterns[pattern_key] = []

                self.patterns[pattern_key].append({
                    "code": code,
                    "score": score,
                    "feedback": galileo_scores[agent]["feedback"],
                    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
                })

                # Keep only top 5 patterns per type
                self.patterns[pattern_key] = sorted(
                    self.patterns[pattern_key],
                    key=lambda p: p["score"],
                    reverse=True
                )[:5]

    async def get_learned_patterns(self, task_type: str, agent: str):
        """Retrieve learned patterns for similar tasks"""
        pattern_key = f"{task_type}_{agent}"
        return self.patterns.get(pattern_key, [])

    async def improve_contribution(self, agent: str, code: str, galileo_feedback: str, learned_patterns: List):

        # Claude re-generates with improvement context
        improved = await agent_reason(agent, improvement_prompt, "")
        return improved
```

### The Improvement Demo (Iteration 1 vs 2):

**Iteration 1** (Cold Start):
```
Task: "Build FastAPI OAuth endpoint"

Agent Contributions:
- Architecture: 92/100 ✅
- Implementation: 88/100 ⚠️ (needs improvement)
- Security: 95/100 ✅
- Testing: 90/100 ✅

Galileo says: "Implementation missing error handling for invalid tokens"

Implementation Agent re-generates with feedback:
- Implementation: 94/100 ✅ (improved!)

Final Synthesis: 92.75/100
Pattern stored ✅
```

**Iteration 2** (With Learning):
```
Task: "Build FastAPI OAuth with refresh tokens"

CodeSwarm loads learned patterns from Iteration 1

Agent Contributions:

- Implementation: 96/100 ✅ (used learned error handling!)
- Security: 96/100 ✅ (learned from previous)
- Testing: 93/100 ✅ (learned from previous)

Final Synthesis: 94.75/100 (BETTER!)

[Show graph: 92.75 → 94.75]
```

**Iteration 3** (Team Learning via WorkOS):
```
Developer 2 joins (via WorkOS SSO)
Task: "Build FastAPI OAuth with MFA"

Loads team patterns from Dev 1's sessions

Agent Contributions:
- All agents: 95-98/100 ✅

Final Synthesis: 96.5/100 (EVEN BETTER!)

[Show graph: 92.75 → 94.75 → 96.5]
```

## 🎮 MULTI-MODEL COLLABORATION (Your Question)

**YES - We can add this for extra wow factor:**

```python
# Multi-model routing by agent specialty

AGENT_MODEL_MAP = {
    "architecture": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514",  # Claude best for system design
    "implementation": "gpt-4o",                     # GPT-4o great for code
    "security": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514",      # Claude excels at security
    "testing": "gpt-4o-mini"                        # Fast model for test gen
}

async def agent_reason(agent_type: str, task: str, docs: str):
    """Route to best model for each agent specialty"""
    model = AGENT_MODEL_MAP[agent_type]

    if "claude" in model:
        # Use Anthropic API (your $50 credits)
        return await claude_complete(model, task, docs)
    else:
        # Use OpenAI API (or OpenRouter)
        return await openai_complete(model, task, docs)
```

**Demo talking point**:
> "Notice we're using Claude for architecture and security - where reasoning depth matters most. GPT-4o for implementation where code generation shines. This is multi-model orchestration at its finest."

---

## 🖥️ IDE INTEGRATION (Your Question)

**Two Paths:**

### Path A: VS Code Extension (If time permits)
```javascript
// codeswarm-vscode/extension.js

vscode.commands.registerCommand('codeswarm.generate', async () => {
    const task = await vscode.window.showInputBox({
        prompt: "What should CodeSwarm build?"
    });

    // Show split-screen webview with 4 agent browsers
    const panel = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel(
        'codeswarmAgents',
        'CodeSwarm Multi-Agent Collaboration',
        vscode.ViewColumn.Beside,
        { enableScripts: true }
    );

    // Stream agent activity to webview
    panel.webview.html = getAgentDashboardHTML();

    // Call CodeSwarm API
    const result = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/generate', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ task })

## 🎬 FINAL DEMO SCRIPT (Under 2 Minutes)

```
[0:00-0:15] THE PROBLEM
"AI coding assistants are generalists. They're okay at everything,
great at nothing. And they never get better with experience."

[0:15-0:30] THE SOLUTION
"CodeSwarm: 4 specialist AI agents that collaborate like senior engineers,
browse documentation in real-time, and improve with every task."

[0:30-0:45] THE SETUP
"Watch as I give CodeSwarm a task in my Daytona workspace..."
[Show Daytona IDE]
Input: "Build secure FastAPI OAuth endpoint with comprehensive tests"

[0:45-1:15] THE MAGIC - SPLIT SCREEN
[Show 4 browser windows + 4 agent panels]

"Watch all 4 agents work simultaneously:
- Architecture Agent browsing OAuth 2.0 specs
- Implementation Agent browsing FastAPI docs
- Security Agent browsing OWASP best practices
- Testing Agent browsing pytest documentation

Each agent uses Claude to reason, Browser Use to gather context,
then generates their specialized contribution."

[See code being written in real-time by each agent]

[1:15-1:30] THE QUALITY GATE
[Show Galileo dashboard]

"Galileo evaluates each contribution:
- Architecture: 92/100 ✅
- Implementation: 88/100 ⚠️
- Security: 95/100 ✅
- Testing: 90/100 ✅

Galileo flags: Implementation needs better error handling.

Watch the Implementation Agent improve with feedback...
New score: 94/100 ✅

Final synthesis: 92.75/100"

[1:30-1:45] THE LEARNING
"CodeSwarm stores this successful pattern.

My teammate logs in via WorkOS SSO...
Similar task: FastAPI OAuth with MFA
Score: 96.5/100 - BETTER because of team learning!"

[Show improvement graph: 92.75 → 96.5]

[1:45-2:00] THE IMPACT
"All code committed to Daytona workspace. Tests passing. Production-ready.

This is the future: Specialist agents, real-time knowledge,
continuous improvement, team collaboration.

Built with Anthropic Claude, Browser Use, Galileo, WorkOS, and Daytona.

CodeSwarm: The coding team that gets better every day."
```

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Post-Hackathon)

As you requested, here's the roadmap to combine all 3 concepts:

### Week 1: Agent Observatory Integration
- Add quality benchmarking across multiple agent types
- Track CodeSwarm agents vs other coding agents
- Public leaderboard of agent quality scores

### Week 2: IDE Extensions
- VS Code extension with split-screen agent view
- JetBrains plugin for IntelliJ/PyCharm
- GitHub Copilot competitor positioning

### Week 3: Advanced Learning
- Multi-task transfer learning (OAuth patterns → Database patterns)
- A/B testing: Which agent combinations work best?
- Reinforcement learning from user code edits

### Month 2: Enterprise Features
- Private team pattern libraries (via WorkOS organizations)
- Compliance & security scanning (SOC2, HIPAA)
- Cost optimization (cheapest model that hits quality threshold)

### Month 3: Agent Marketplace
- Developers can create + sell specialized agents
- Community-contributed agents (Frontend Agent, DevOps Agent)
- Revenue share model

**The Vision**: "GitHub Copilot meets Multi-Agent Orchestration meets Continuous Learning"
