- Add new models to `all_models` list
- Update `known_dates` dictionary
- Modify scoring logic in `identify_best_for_code_generation()`
- Run script to regenerate reports

---

## Reviewer Verification

### Validate Model Availability
Before implementing, verify models exist on OpenRouter:
```bash
# Check model availability via OpenRouter API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
     https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models
```

### Test Individual Models
```python
# Test a specific model
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="your-key"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a quicksort"}]
)
```
