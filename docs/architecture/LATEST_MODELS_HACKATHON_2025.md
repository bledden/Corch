4. **Faster Iteration**: Latest models generate code 2-3x faster

## Multi-Model Strategy

Our orchestrator uses **Thompson Sampling** to intelligently select the best model for each task:

```python
# Each agent learns which model performs best for different tasks
agents = {
    'architect': ['o4-mini-high', 'gpt-5-pro', 'gemini-2.5-pro', 'claude-sonnet-4.5'],
    'coder': ['gpt-5', 'claude-4-opus', 'deepseek-v3', 'deepseek-r1'],
    'reviewer': ['o3-pro', 'o3', 'claude-opus-4.1', 'deepseek-r1'],
    'documenter': ['gemini-2.5-flash', 'claude-3-7-sonnet', 'o3-mini'],
    'researcher': ['gemini-2.5-pro', 'perplexity-r1', 'gpt-5-pro', 'deepseek-r1']
}
```
