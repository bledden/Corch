# Quality Evaluation System

## Problem Statement

The original benchmark used **hardcoded quality scores**:
- Sequential: Always 0.8 on success, 0.3 on failure
- Baseline: Always 0.8 if has code + logic

This made the results **meaningless** - we couldn't actually measure quality differences between approaches.

## Solution: Objective Quality Metrics

We now use `CodeQualityEvaluator` which measures **6 objective dimensions**:

### 1. Correctness (30% weight)
- **Python**: AST parsing - does it compile?
- **Other**: Basic syntax checks
- **Score**: 1.0 if valid, 0.0 if syntax errors

### 2. Completeness (25% weight)
Checks if code addresses task requirements:
- Has function/class definition (0.5 points)
- Has return statements (0.2 points)
- Has control flow logic (0.2 points)
- Has necessary imports (0.1 points)

### 3. Code Quality (20% weight)
Structural quality checks:
- Line length < 100 chars
- Meaningful variable names (not x, y, z)
- Proper spacing
- Type hints (bonus: +0.1)

### 4. Documentation (10% weight)
- Docstrings (0.6 points)
- Comments (0.2 points)
- Module-level docstring (0.2 points)

### 5. Error Handling (10% weight)
- try/except blocks (0.5 points)
- Input validation (0.3 points)
- finally blocks (bonus: 0.2 points)

### 6. Testing (5% weight)
- Test functions (0.5 points)
- Assertions (0.3 points)
- Test frameworks (0.2 points)

## Example Scores

### Good Code (0.80)
```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate factorial of n using recursion"""
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative")
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

assert factorial(5) == 120
```

**Scores**:
- Correctness: 1.00 (valid syntax)
- Completeness: 0.70 (has function, return, logic)
- Code Quality: 1.00 (clean, type hints)
- Documentation: 0.80 (docstring)
- Error Handling: 0.30 (validation)
- Testing: 0.30 (assertion)
- **Overall: 0.80**

### Bad Code (0.68)
```python
def f(x):
    if x==0:return 1
    return x*f(x-1)
```

**Scores**:
- Correctness: 1.00 (valid syntax)
- Completeness: 0.70 (has function, return, logic)
- Code Quality: 1.00 (short, no issues)
- Documentation: 0.00 (none)
- Error Handling: 0.00 (none)
- Testing: 0.00 (none)
- **Overall: 0.68 (FAIL - below 0.70 threshold)**

## Key Differences from Original

| Aspect | Original | New System |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Quality Score** | Hardcoded 0.8 | Calculated from code analysis |
| **Variation** | None (always 0.8) | Real variation (0.0 - 1.0) |
| **Dimensions** | Single score | 6 detailed dimensions |
| **Language Support** | Generic | Python, JS, Java, generic |
| **Pass Threshold** | quality > 0.7 | Same, but real scores |

## Usage

### In Benchmark
```python
from quality_evaluator import CodeQualityEvaluator, detect_language

evaluator = CodeQualityEvaluator(pass_threshold=0.7)

# Evaluate code
language = detect_language(code)
result = evaluator.evaluate(code, task_description, language)

# Use real scores
quality_score = result.overall  # 0.0 - 1.0
passed = result.passed  # True if >= 0.70
dimensions = result.dimensions  # Detailed breakdown
```

### Standalone
```python
python3 quality_evaluator.py
```

## Limitations

This is a **lightweight evaluator** that doesn't require test execution. For production:

### Current Limitations:
1. **No semantic correctness** - Doesn't verify logic is correct
2. **No test execution** - Doesn't run code to verify behavior
3. **Language-specific** - Best for Python, generic for others
4. **Heuristic-based** - Uses patterns, not deep analysis

### Future Improvements:
1. **LLM-as-judge** - Use GPT-4 to evaluate semantic correctness
2. **Test execution** - Run unit tests to verify behavior
3. **Static analysis** - Integrate pylint, mypy, etc.
4. **Complexity metrics** - Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index
5. **Security scanning** - Detect vulnerabilities

## Why This Matters

The original benchmark showed:
- Sequential: 90% Pass@1, 0.80 avg quality
- Baseline: 100% Pass@1, 0.80 avg quality

But the **0.80 was hardcoded**, so we couldn't claim quality differences.

With real evaluation, we can now **legitimately measure**:
- Is sequential code actually higher quality?
- Which approach produces better documentation?
- Which handles errors better?
- Which has better test coverage?

## Running New Benchmark

```bash
# Old benchmark (hardcoded scores)
python3 run_10_task_quick_benchmark.py

# New benchmark (real quality evaluation)
python3 run_10_task_benchmark_v2.py
```

The v2 benchmark will show **real quality differences** that we can actually claim in research or marketing.
