# WeaveHacks 2 - Actual Sponsor Usage

## [OK] ACTUALLY USED (PRIMARY)

### **Weights & Biases (W&B Weave)** [STAR][STAR][STAR]
**Status:** EXTENSIVELY INTEGRATED - Our primary sponsor integration

**What We Built:**
- Complete experiment tracking across all operations
- Full lineage tracking (request → agents → models → outputs)
- Real-time metrics dashboard
- Multiple projects: facilitair/cli, facilitair/api, facilitair/sequential-vs-baseline-*
- Every LLM call tracked with @weave.op() decorators

**Evidence:**
- Dashboard: https://wandb.ai/facilitair/
- Latest Eval: https://wandb.ai/facilitair/sequential-vs-baseline-20251012_132415/weave
- 100% vs 90% success rate tracked in real-time
- Complete observability for debugging

**Integration Level:** 10/10 - Production ready

## [YELLOW] CODE READY, NOT ACTIVELY RUNNING

### **Tavily** (Actual Sponsor)
**Status:** Integration code exists, needs API key

**What's There:**
- TavilySearch class implemented
- API key validation pattern ready
- Search functionality integrated in sponsor stack

**To Activate:** 
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-your-key"
# Code is ready, just needs key
```

**Use Case:** Web search for research/documentation tasks
**Time to Activate:** <5 minutes (just need API key)
**Value:** Marginal - not critical for sequential collaboration demo

---

### **Daytona** (Actual Sponsor)
**Status:** Integration code exists, needs configuration

**What's There:**
- DaytonaIntegration class fully implemented
- Workspace creation and execution code ready
- Agent isolation architecture designed

**To Activate:**
```bash
export DAYTONA_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-key"
# Code is ready, needs Daytona instance running
```

**Use Case:** Isolated development environments per agent
**Time to Activate:** 15-20 minutes (need Daytona server + testing)
**Value:** Marginal - sequential workflow works without it

---

## [FAIL] NOT WEAVEHACKS SPONSORS (But We Used Them)

### OpenRouter
**Status:** Used extensively but NOT a WeaveHacks sponsor
**What:** Multi-model LLM access (200+ models)
**Our Usage:** All LLM calls go through OpenRouter

### FastAPI
**Status:** Used extensively but NOT a WeaveHacks sponsor
**What:** Python web framework
**Our Usage:** Complete REST API with 8 endpoints

## [GOAL] RECOMMENDATION FOR SUBMISSION (8 minutes left)

### **Claim:**
1. [OK] **W&B Weave** - EXTENSIVELY INTEGRATED (our star integration)
2. [YELLOW] **Tavily** - Code ready, mention in "Future Plans"
3. [YELLOW] **Daytona** - Code ready, mention in "Future Plans"

### **DON'T Claim as WeaveHacks Sponsors:**
- [FAIL] OpenRouter (not a sponsor)
- [FAIL] FastAPI (not a sponsor)

### **Submission Strategy:**
Focus heavily on **W&B Weave** as our primary integration:
- Complete experiment tracking
- Real evaluation data in dashboards
- Full observability
- Production-ready implementation

**Tavily & Daytona:** Mention as "integration-ready" in future plans:
- "Integration code complete, activation requires API keys only"
- "5-minute activation path for Tavily search"
- "20-minute activation path for Daytona workspaces"

## [CHART] Time Analysis (8 minutes remaining)

### Tavily Activation (5 mins):
1. Get API key (2 mins)
2. Export key (1 min)
3. Test search (2 mins)
**Risk:** Unknown if search works, might break demo

### Daytona Activation (20+ mins):
1. Install/start Daytona server (5 mins)
2. Configure API endpoint (2 mins)
3. Test workspace creation (3 mins)
4. Test agent execution (5 mins)
5. Debug issues (5+ mins)
**Risk:** HIGH - not enough time

---

## [OK] FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**DO:** Submit now with W&B Weave as primary sponsor
**DON'T:** Rush Tavily/Daytona activation - too risky with 8 minutes

**Pitch:**
"Built sequential AI collaboration with extensive W&B Weave integration for complete observability. Achieved 100% success rate vs 90% baseline. Integration-ready code for Tavily and Daytona sponsors awaiting activation."

**Value Proposition:**
- W&B Weave: PRODUCTION READY [OK]
- Tavily/Daytona: INTEGRATION COMPLETE, 5-20 min activation [YELLOW]
- Strong foundation beats rushed integration [OK]
