    - deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3           # 98/100 - SOTA code model
    - openai/o1                          # 96/100 - Best reasoning
    - alibaba/qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct # 95/100 - Dedicated coder
    - alibaba/qwq-32b-preview            # 94/100 - Problem solving
    - anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet        # 94/100 - Python expert

    # Tier 2: Fast/efficient alternatives
    - openai/o1-mini                     # 93/100 - Fast reasoning
