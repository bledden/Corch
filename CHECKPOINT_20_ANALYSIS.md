# Checkpoint 20 Analysis: Hallucination Detection Limitation

## Finding: Cannot Detect Hallucinations from Checkpoint Files

**Problem:** The checkpoint files don't store the actual generated code outputs - only the evaluation scores. This was a storage optimization decision, but it prevents post-hoc hallucination analysis.

**Checkpoint Structure:**
```json
{
  "sequential": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "category": "security_critical",
      "method": "sequential",
      "pass": true,
      "quality_score": 0.755,
      "quality_dimensions": {...},
      "language": "python",
      "duration": 45.2,
      "hallucination": false  // This was always false in original eval!
    }
  ]
}
```

**Missing:** The actual `output` field with generated code.

## Current Results Without Hallucination Detection

### Tasks 1-20 (Security-Critical Code Category)

| Metric | Sequential | Baseline | Winner |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Avg Quality Score** | 0.763 | 0.534 | **Sequential +0.229** |
| **Pass Rate** | 14/20 (70%) | 10/20 (50%) | **Sequential** |
| **Tasks Won** | 14 | 6 | **Sequential** |

**Sequential Advantage:** +42.9% higher quality, +20% more passes

### Top Sequential Wins (Security Tasks):
1. **Task 11** (CSP header): Sequential 0.940 vs Baseline 0.845 (+0.095)
2. **Task 5** (XSS sanitizer): Sequential 0.900 vs Baseline 0.500 (+0.400)
3. **Task 15** (Audit logger): Sequential 0.880 vs Baseline 0.390 (+0.490) ⭐
4. **Task 16** (2FA tokens): Sequential 0.900 vs Baseline 0.355 (+0.545) ⭐⭐
5. **Task 12** (AES-256): Sequential 0.820 vs Baseline 0.370 (+0.450) ⭐

### Baseline Wins:
- **Task 8** (Session manager): Baseline 0.810 vs Sequential 0.480 (-0.330)
- **Task 13** (OAuth2): Baseline 0.675 vs Sequential 0.455 (-0.220)
- **Task 14** (RBAC): Baseline 0.920 vs Sequential 0.845 (-0.075)
- **Task 19** (WebSocket): Baseline 0.690 vs Sequential 0.475 (-0.215)

## The Hallucination Risk

**Without semantic relevance checking, these quality scores could be inflated!**

Example scenario:
- Task: "Implement password hashing with bcrypt"
- Hallucinated Output: Perfect JWT token validator (wrong problem!)
- Current Score: 0.75+ (syntax ✓, structure ✓, docs ✓)
- **Should Score:** 0.0 (solves wrong problem!)

### Estimated Impact

If 10-20% of outputs are hallucinations:
```
Current Sequential: 0.763
Real Sequential:    0.763 × 0.80 = 0.610 (if 20% hallucinated)

Current Baseline:   0.534
Real Baseline:      0.534 × 0.80 = 0.427 (if 20% hallucinated)
```

**Hypothesis:** Sequential likely has FEWER hallucinations because:
1. Architect stage establishes clear requirements → reduces off-topic implementations
2. Reviewer stage catches misaligned code → forces corrections
3. Multiple stages provide error correction → iterative refinement toward task

## Solutions

### Immediate (For Remaining 80 Tasks):
1. **Modify benchmark to save outputs** in checkpoints (storage cost is acceptable for 100 tasks)
2. **Run semantic analysis** on Tasks 21-100 as they complete
3. **Compare hallucination rates** between Sequential and Baseline

### Short-term (For Future Benchmarks):
1. **Integrate semantic relevance** as 7th quality dimension (15% weight)
2. **Flag low-relevance outputs** (<0.5) for manual review
3. **Report hallucination metrics** alongside quality scores

### Long-term (Production):
1. **LLM-as-judge** for ambiguous cases (expensive but accurate)
2. **Build hallucination dataset** from flagged examples
3. **Train lightweight classifier** for fast detection

## Weave Integration

The actual outputs ARE stored in Weave:
```
https://wandb.ai/facilitair/100-task-benchmark/weave
```

Each task has a Weave call with full I/O, but:
- Requires API/web scraping to retrieve
- Not included in checkpoint JSON for size reasons
- Alternative: Modify benchmark to include outputs in checkpoints

## Recommendation

**Option A (Fast):** Accept current scores as upper bound, acknowledge hallucination risk in write-up

**Option B (Accurate):**
1. Modify run_100_task_benchmark.py to save outputs in checkpoints
2. Re-run remaining 80 tasks with output saving
3. Run semantic analysis on all completed tasks
4. Report adjusted scores with hallucination detection

**My Recommendation:** Option B for Tasks 21-100. The hallucination insight is TOO IMPORTANT to ignore for a benchmark validation project.

## Code Changes Needed

```python
# In run_100_task_benchmark.py, line ~250:
results.append({
    "task_id": task_id,
    "category": category,
    "method": "sequential",
    "pass": quality_result.passed,
    "quality_score": quality_result.overall,
    "quality_dimensions": quality_result.dimensions,
    "language": language,
    "duration": duration,
    "hallucination": False,  # <-- This was placeholder!
    "output": result.final_output,  # ADD THIS LINE
    "task_description": task["description"]  # ADD THIS LINE TOO
})
```

Then semantic analysis can work on checkpoints!
